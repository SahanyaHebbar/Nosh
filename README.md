Event Food Management System based on number of attendees

--ABSTRACT--
India is home to over a billion people, accommodating incredible cultural diversity between languages, geographic regions, religious traditions, and social stratifications. With such rich culture comes a great deal of festivities and celebrations. Every Indian gathering is a grand affair that usually ends with a whole lot of leftover food. All of this is generally thrown away and only adds to food wastage which is an alarming issue in India. According to UN estimates, 40 percent of the food produced in India is either lost or wasted. With numbers as high as these, the country’s current systems aren’t able to cope up and are hence leading to negative effects on the environment and human health. Therefore, we tried to address the problem with our project wherein the focus would be to minimize wastage by producing the right amount of food required for the gathering.

--OBJECTIVE--
The objective of our project is to design an efficient system to allow the invitees to rsvp anonymously and give the organizers a better estimate of the total number of attendees.

--PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM--
Food for most social gatherings is prepared based on the number of invitees, which is not a suitable method, since many times, most invitees are unable to attend the event due to prior commitments. These extra plates of food, when not consumed, are thrown mercilessly into bins, therefore wasting large amounts of food resources.

--OUR SOLUTION--
We plan on developing a web application where one (the organizer) can register their event, or gathering. They will be required to enter their name, the date and time, the venue, and the event type. The application will then generate a unique identification number that can be circulated amongst the invitees. The invitees can head over to the website, enter the event ID and anonymously let the organizers know the number of people attending the event from their side. The organizers can then view the final number of attendees and arrange food accordingly. They will also have the option to contact a wide range of NGOs, that work towards eradicating world hunger, and have them pick up the excess food.
